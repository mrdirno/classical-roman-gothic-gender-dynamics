## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where Livia uses her knowledge of philosophy or poetry to subtly undermine her fiancé in public, a weapon he cannot perceive.
- Draft a monologue from Cassius's perspective as he observes the household, detailing the 'tasks of discretion' he has performed for Drusus and his first impressions of Livia.
- Create a clandestine meeting between Livia and a non-elite woman (a slave, a merchant's wife) that reveals a different axis of power and survival in Rome.
- Write the betrothal ceremony scene, focusing on the sensory details—the smells, the oppressive weight of clothing, the empty rituals—that highlight Livia's internal gothic horror.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a 'Drip Calculator' web app that visualizes the persistent, maddening leak in the atrium as a metaphor for Livia's dwindling time and sanity, with each 'plink' generating a line of constrained poetry.
- Create a network graph of the Roman patronage system ('clientela') as depicted in the novel, linking characters like Drusus, Cassius, the Aelii, and others, with edge weights representing debts, obligations, and hidden threats.
